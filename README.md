# Predicting Patients Survival

### Dataset
The dataset contains the patient records collected from a hospital in Greenland. The "Survived_1_year" column is a target variable which has binary entries (0 or 1).
Survived_1_year == 0, implies that the patient did not survive after 1 year of treatment. Survived_1_year == 1, implies that the patient survived after 1 year of treatment.

### Objective
Develop a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).

#### *This was the final assignment for my Data Science Bootcamp.

### Results
- I built 3 classification models and compared their performances.
- I used hyperparameter's tuning to improve the best model.
- I also used the Recursive Feature Elimination method to try improving the performance
- My best model got a f1-score of 0.86 and accuracy of 0.82.
